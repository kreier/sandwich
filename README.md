Testcase following the introduction to SwiftUI on WWDC 2020

Instruction video is here: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10119

## Repository

Apple and Jacob Xiao & Kyle Macomber did not provide their code, so Jay Pricer made it available:

Another, probably more complete example is here:

## Challenges

Some part's don't work, like the missing HStack before replaced with NavigationView at minute 10.
